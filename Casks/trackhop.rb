  caveats <<~EOS
    Trackhop is not signed with Apple's developer certificate. The first time, macOS refuses to
    open it: open System Settings > Privacy & Security and choose "Open Anyway" for Trackhop.
    Guide: https://xlollx.github.io/Trackhop/guide/desktop#macos
    The command line is `trackhop` (Trackhop must be running).
